# Shoots and Ladders - A Swift 3 Playground

A Swift Playground that creates a random Shoots and Ladders game auto-played by the computer

You can just copy the Contents.swift file into a new playground and run it.

You can change some gamne options by editing the following constants:
```swift
let numPlayers:Int = 5 //the number of players, maximum is 5
let boardSize:Int = 8 //creates an X by X board, avoid going above 10
let turnInterval:Double = 3 //in seconds, slows down or speeds up the game
```
